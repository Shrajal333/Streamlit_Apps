### RNN for Sentiment Analysis:
The IMDB movies dataset is loaded with a vocabulary of 50000 words and a simple RNN with max padding of 500 is trained on the dataset with 5 layers using the sigmoid activation function, with EarlyStopping monitoring the validation losses. Further, the neural network is deployed using Streamlit which predicts the sentiment score for the entered customer review.
