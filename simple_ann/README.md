### ANN for Customer Churn:
The dataset is loaded, categorical variables are encoded and the numerical variables are scaled which are then saved in pickle files. A simple neural network with 5 layers predicts the probability of churn with a 87% validation accuracy. Finally the application is deployed on Streamlit which predicts the outcome in real-time using the trained neural network.
